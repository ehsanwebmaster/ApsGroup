          She began her acting career at age 17 with the leading role in I'm
          Taraneh, 15 (Rasul Sadr Ameli, 2002). Critics praised her performance
          as a defiant 15-year-old girl who after a failed relationship is
          determined to rear a child on her own, while struggling with poverty
          and social stigma. She won the Bronze Leopard for Best Actress from
          the Locarno International Film Festival in 2002,as well as the Crystal
          Simorgh for Best Actress from the 20th Fajr Film Festival, becoming
          the youngest person ever to do so. Shortly after she set another
          record, getting nominated three consecutive times for the best actress
          prize at the Fajr Film Festival for her first three films. Since then
          she has maintained a steady but selective workflow in both theatre and
          cinema. She is mostly known for her choosy criteria in accepting
          challenging, dramatic roles, as exemplified by her long collaboration
          with Oscar winner Asghar Farhadi, making her one of the most acclaimed
          actresses of her generation. A prominent actress in Iran, she has
          bagged many awards and accolades. Alidoosti played the title role
          during the three seasons of the hit Iranian TV series Shahrzad. Fluent
          in German and English, Alidoosti has also translated books by Alice
          Munro and Nicole Krauss from English to Persian.
