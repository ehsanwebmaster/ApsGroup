            <h3>Career</h3><hr>
            <p>She began her acting career at age 17 with the leading role in I'm Taraneh, 15 (Rasul Sadr Ameli, 2002). Critics praised her performance as a defiant 15-year-old girl who after a failed relationship is determined to rear a child on her own, while struggling with poverty and social stigma. She won the Bronze Leopard for Best Actress from the Locarno International Film Festival in 2002,as well as the Crystal Simorgh for Best Actress from the 20th Fajr Film Festival, becoming the youngest person ever to do so. Shortly after she set another record, getting nominated three consecutive times for the best actress prize at the Fajr Film Festival for her first three films. Since then she has maintained a steady but selective workflow in both theatre and cinema. She is mostly known for her choosy criteria in accepting challenging, dramatic roles, as exemplified by her long collaboration with Oscar winner Asghar Farhadi, making her one of the most acclaimed actresses of her generation. A prominent actress in Iran, she has bagged many awards and accolades.
                Alidoosti played the title role during the three seasons of the hit Iranian TV series Shahrzad.
                Fluent in German and English, Alidoosti has also translated books by Alice Munro and Nicole Krauss from English to Persian.</p>
